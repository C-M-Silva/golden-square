Single-Method Programs Design Recipe

1. Describe the Problem

Create a method that takes one parameter ('words' == string) and estimates the reading time returned as an interger... Assuming 
the average is 200 words per minute.

2. Design the Method Signature

def reading_time(words*)        * words is a string
    ...
    return result*              * result should equal an interger value
end

time = reading_time("*200 words written here*")

return time ==> 1 min

3. Create Examples as Tests

reading_time("*100 words go here*") => "Approx 30 seconds"

reading_time("*200 words go here*") => "Approx 1 min"

reading_time("*300 words go here*") => "Approx 1.3 min"

reading_time("*400 words go here*") => "Approx 2 min"

4. Implement the Behaviour
